 # The Luthier Project
 ### A web application for the design of instruments and bows of the violin family.
 ____
 Instrument and bow making is more than an art, besides the pure craftmanship, luthiers also have to be knowledgeful and familiar with a wide set of subjects like materials and acoustics.
 Traditionally, luthiers have made their designs based in old instruments and bows, often by directly copying the outline of famous instruments and the gradation and camber of bows.  
 My intention is to provide a free online tool where luthiers can draft the initial design of the instrument and bow.

 ## The Instrument.
 Using the method described by François Denis in his fantastic "Traité de Lutherie" book, the web application will provide the outline of the instrument (violin, viola, cello or double bass) at 1:1 scale, based on certain parameters (introduced by the user):

 ## The instrument bow. Gradation and Camber.
 Similar to the instrument application, the user will be able to select the gradation law for the bow and based on the wood stick mechanical properties a reference bow camber will be produced.
 
Example, Violin Bow gradation:

Analyzing the stick material mechanical properties a reference camber will be obtained.
In the following example, we can see the bow deflection (camber) for different loads in function of the critical buckling load:

### The Luthier Project is currently in development.
### Expected completion: Fall-Winter 2022.
